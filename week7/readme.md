# Tricks
## Colon feature ':'
- To get a chunk from a list use ':' 
    For eg:
        4:10 means 4 to 10
        :-35 minus bottom 35 of the list
        ::-1 give the list from last term to first term
        -3:  gives the last 3 terms
## Append vs Extend 
- __Append__ adds onto the list (good for co-ordinates)
- __Extend__ adds onto the current list by forming the two together to create one list
